# Feather Huzzah32 Debug Shield

A shield to allow for easy connection to the ESP-Prog board to allow for debugging of ESP32 code using platform.io

**Note:** This is only compatible with the Huzzah32, it will not work with any other feathers.

## Required Additional Hardware

On top of the BOM(which is one part), you will need the following

- [Feather Huzzah32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)
- ESP-Prog
  - [With IDC Cables\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_99ab5G) - It's actually cheaper for me anyways as shipping is cheaper.
  - [Without Cables\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ABmPLg)

## Optional Additional Hardware

- [10p, 2.54 pitch IDC cable\*](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ACxvMA) - This will connect directly from the ESP-Prog into the shield. Not needed if you buy the ESP-Prog with cables. You could do this with jumpers either, but this is kind of the whole point of the shield :D
- [12p & 16p Female headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2886) - Useful to use as a socket for removing the Feather from the board.
